# bash-script-Scheduling-to-Automate-VM-Data-Backups-Replication-to-an-Amazon-S3-Bucket-

Create a bash script that runs on a schedule to compress and backup critical data on a virtual machine (EC2 Instance) in AWS.
Automate the backup replication to an Amazon S3 Bucket.
â€¢ Key Features:

- Backup Scheduling: Allow users to schedule backups at specific times or intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly)
- Backup Compression: Compress the backup files to save storage space using
  the tar command with gzip (tar -czf) or other compression methods.
- Logging: Create log files to record backup operations, including start time, end time, and any errors encountered during the backup.
- AWS Integration: Seamlessly integrate with the AWS Command Line
  Interface (CLI) for secure and efficient uploads to Amazon S3.
